# react-profile

## Description

Welcome to my personal profile using react. This is a project that I created to practice my skills in react. I used tailwindcss to style my page. I also used webpack to bundle my files. I used express to run my server. I used node.js to run my javascript. I used javascript to create my components. I used HTML to create my elements. I used react to create my components. I used react-dom to render my components. I used react-router-dom to create my routes. I used react-scripts to run my react app. I used react-hook-form to create my forms. I used react-app-rewire-postcss to create my react app.

Enjoy!
